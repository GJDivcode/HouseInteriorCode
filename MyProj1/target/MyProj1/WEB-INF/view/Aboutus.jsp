<p>Ironically, the Bootstrap documentation page itself has a sticky footer
 alongside bootstrap styling and a fixed top navbar. It's all custom css though, 
 and not part of the framework. So an obvious route is to take and refactor their 
 custom styling, since it obviously plays well within the Bootstrap framework,
  but that seems more painful than it ought to be.</p>
